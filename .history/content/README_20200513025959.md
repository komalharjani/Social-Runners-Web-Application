# Gem Heist - students' practical for module cs5003 @ University of St Andrews CS
Gem Heist is a custom multi-player board game based around the classic Dots-and-Boxes game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes.

## Prerequisites
The clients or front-ends are meant to run in a web browser. They makes use of standard ES6 functionality and are compliant with all newer versions of modern browsers (Chrome).
The game's server requires node.js. It was developed using node v8.9.4. It should be compatible with all versions of node that support ES6.
Express.js 4.17 is also required.
For a full list of all required packages please refer to "package.json".

## Instructions to run
Cd into the game's root directory. Start the game's server with the command "node server.js".
In a browser (provided you run the game locally) type in http://localhost:3000/ to start a client. Since at least 2 players are needed to play the game you will need to start another client in a different tab, window or browser.

## Coding, reusability, maintainability
The server-side code is split into these files: server.js, model.js, config.js, dao.js:  
**model.js** provides a model for validating a new user submission for the database
**server.js** starts and controls the program flow on the server-side. Provides all endpoints for the communication between clients and the database
**config.js** config files provide configuration details 

The client relies on three files: index.html, main.js and style.css all 
**index.html** basic html scaffolding and use of google Maps API
**style.css** styling and layout 
**client.js** client-side code for the UI

## Built With
ES6 object oriented javascript
Node.js
Express.js
CouchDB
Google Maps API (Places)
